TankAI — AI-Powered GitHub Project Analyzer
TankAI is an intelligent automation tool designed to generate detailed and structured project reports by analyzing GitHub repositories. It dives deep into the codebase, uncovers the underlying architecture, and provides an in-depth overview of the project’s structure, dependencies, and logic flow—making it easier to understand, document, or showcase your work.

What It Does
Automatically scans the repository and maps out folders, files, and their relationships.
Identifies dependencies and inter-file connections to build a high-level architecture view.
Breaks down the codebase into logical chunks (like components, modules, or functions).
Summarizes each file and its role in the project using NLP and LLM-based techniques.
Generates a human-readable project report covering setup instructions, folder structure, file purposes, and a comprehensive overview of the entire codebase.

Tech Stack
NLP, ML & LLMs (Large Language Models)
Code structure analysis
GitHub integration
File and dependency mapping

Use Cases
Onboarding new developers into large/complex codebases
Auto-documentation for open-source or internal projects
Simplifying codebase reviews for recruiters or collaborators
Understanding unfamiliar repositories quickly

Note (Current Scope)
TankAI is in a premature development stage. While designed as a general-purpose GitHub analyzer, it currently supports MERN stack projects only (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Support for other languages and frameworks is in progress.
